## Overview

[//]: # (TODO: Add overview mentioning the purpose of the module, supported REST API versions, and other high-level details.)

[HubSpot](https://www.hubspot.com/) is an customer platform with all the software, integrations, and resources users need to connect thier marketing, sales, and customer service.

The `ballerinax/hubspot.crm.commerce.quotes` package offers APIs to connect and interact with [HubSpot API for CRM Quotes](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/reference/api/crm/commerce/quotes) endpoints, specifically based on [HubSpot CRM Quotes API v3 OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/HubSpot/HubSpot-public-api-spec-collection/blob/main/PublicApiSpecs/CRM/Quotes/Rollouts/424/v3/quotes.json).


## Setup guide

[//]: # (TODO: Add detailed steps to obtain credentials and configure the module.)

To use the HubSpot CRM Lists connector, you must have access to the HubSpot API through a HubSpot developer account and a HubSpot App under it. Therefore you need to register for a developer account at HubSpot if you don't have one already.

### Step 1: Create/Login to a HubSpot Developer Account

If you have an account already, go to the [HubSpot developer portal](https://app.hubspot.com/)

If you don't have a HubSpot Developer Account you can sign up to a free account [here](https://developers.hubspot.com/get-started)

### Step 2 (Optional): Create a [Developer Test Account](https://developers.hubspot.com/beta-docs/getting-started/account-types#developer-test-accounts) under your account

Within app developer accounts, you can create developer test accounts to test apps and integrations without affecting any real HubSpot data.

**_These accounts are only for development and testing purposes. In production you should not use Developer Test Accounts._**

1. Go to Test Account section from the left sidebar.
